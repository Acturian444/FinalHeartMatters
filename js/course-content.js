    beforeBegin: `<p>No one signs up for heartbreak. It hits hard, fast, and without warning. One minute you're planning a future, the next, you're grieving what you thought would last.</p>
<p>If you're here, it means something cracked open. And now, you get to decide what comes next. Right now, it probably feels like your world just fell apart. But what if this moment—the one that feels like the end—is actually the beginning of everything you've been needing?</p>
<p>That's the crazy thing about pain. It doesn't feel like transformation when you're in it — it just feels like chaos. But when we look back, the moments that shaped us were always the darkest ones. They pushed us to change, to shift, to do things we never would've done otherwise.</p>
<p>You might not see it yet, but you're exactly where you need to be. This course is your roadmap back to yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here's what you need to know:</p>
<p>This is a 22-day journey. Each day builds on the last. You'll get daily readings, healing activities, and journaling prompts designed to help you move through the pain and come out stronger on the other side.</p>
<p>The course is designed to be done in order. Each day unlocks the next, so you can't skip ahead. This isn't about rushing through — it's about giving yourself the time and space to heal properly.</p>
<p>Your progress is saved locally on your device. No one else can see it. This is your private healing space.</p>

      reading: `<p>If you're here, it probably means you're going through a breakup you didn't fully want. Maybe they ended it. Maybe it was mutual but still painful. Or maybe you walked away because you had no other choice, even though your heart wasn't ready.</p>
<p>Either way, we're honored to walk this healing journey with you. Over the next 22 days, we'll help you move through the pain, reconnect with yourself, and open your heart again.</p>

      title: 'Day 1: Acceptance',
      reading: `<p><em>“Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery.”</em></p>
<p>Right now, it might feel like you’ll never get past this pain. You’re grieving the end of a relationship. We’ve all been there. We know what it feels like. You’re not alone. Broken hearts happen to the strongest people, and there’s light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>You will move through this, and we’re here to walk that path with you. Even if you're still living with your ex, you can begin by accepting what’s real right now.</p>
<p>No matter how it ended — whether they left, it was mutual, or you walked away — healing begins when you accept the reality of it. That includes the part you and your ex each played.</p>
<p>It’s easy to resist pain. To numb it with drinking, distraction, rebound sex. But that only delays the healing and usually leaves you feeling worse.</p>
<p>The most common mistake? Fighting your emotions. When we resist what we feel, we store pain inside and feed the part of us that wants to self-sabotage.</p>
<p>Your first real step today is simple but powerful: <strong>Accept that it’s over.</strong> At least for now. Stop analyzing what could’ve been different. There are a thousand “what ifs,” and chasing them only pulls you deeper into pain.</p>
<p>Today is about facing your reality head-on. Whatever you’re feeling — anger, confusion, sadness, guilt — agree with it. That doesn’t mean you like it. It just means you’re no longer fighting it.</p>
<p>If you want to let go of anger, start by saying: “I’m angry, and that’s okay.” Let your thoughts and emotions exist. Don’t resist, argue, or shame them. Feel them. Name them. Allow them. That’s how they lose control over you.</p>
<p>Because the truth is: you have to feel it to heal it. The only way out is through. Every time you cry, you’re processing. Every ache in your chest means your heart is adjusting. Every tear is a step forward.</p>
<p>Let yourself fall apart today, if you need to. Cry your heart out to release all the stress, anxiety, and anger you may be feeling. Scream into a pillow. Give yourself space to release. You don’t need to fix anything today — just feel.</p>
<p>Healing happens moment by moment, day by day. Your only job right now is to trust the process and take it one breath at a time.</p>`,
      task: `<p><strong>Day 1 Task — Digital Detox & No Contact</strong></p>
<p>In addition to your daily routine from the habit journal, today’s task is a big one — and it’s essential: <strong>Cut all contact and start a digital detox.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No texting, no calling, no “just checking in.”</li>
  <li>No emails, no meeting up.</li>
  <li>This isn’t forever — but while your heart is raw, distance is protection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Digital Detox Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Unfriend, unfollow, hide from your feed, mute, or block your ex on all platforms</li>
  <li>Delete or archive old messages and photos.</li>
  <li>Block their number, even if just for now.</li>
  <li>Consider taking a break from social media altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re reluctant to do this, keep in mind that you can always reconnect with them later when the heartbreak isn’t so fresh. Your priority now is your peace.</p>
<p><strong>Feeling tempted to reach out or snoop?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Text a supportive friend</li>
  <li>Go for a walk or move your body</li>
  <li>Watch something light or funny</li>
  <li>Journal it out, dance it off — just don’t spiral in their direction</li>
</ul>
<p>Detox = clarity. Space = power. This is your first act of reclaiming it.</p>`,

      day: 2,
      title: 'Day 2: Create Distance',
      reading: `<p><em>“Home isn’t a place — it’s a feeling.”</em></p>
<p>The second step in healing is to find your version of home. A safe space where you can fall apart, soften, and begin your love detox. The sooner you create that space, the sooner you’ll start letting go and shift from we back to I.</p>
<p>Right now, the emotional rollercoaster might be peaking. The headache, the heart drop, the overwhelm — it’s all part of it. But this part matters: <strong>You need space from your ex. At least for now.</strong></p>
<p>Cutting contact, even temporarily, gives your nervous system a chance to breathe.</p>
<p>We get it. People often want to “stay friends” or “talk things through,” but when it’s this fresh, forcing connection only slows your healing. Space = clarity. Distance = peace.</p>
<p>Maybe your home felt like it was with your ex. That’s what makes this so painful. But you’re not without a home — it might be with your family, your best friend, or even in a quiet room that’s finally yours again. Wherever you are, surround yourself with people who love you. Let them remind you who you are outside of this heartbreak.</p>
<p>Still living with them? That’s real and scary. But your healing still comes first.</p>
<p><strong>If you can move out:</strong> Make a plan and stick to it. Move in with someone safe and supportive, even short-term. Don’t wait for it to “feel okay.” It probably won’t.</p>
<p><strong>If you can’t move out right now:</strong> Take a short solo trip or weekend away — a new environment can help reset your nervous system and give you perspective. Spend a night or two at a friend’s place — somewhere you feel safe and cared for. A familiar face and space can work wonders. Set clear boundaries in the shared space — separate bedrooms, divided routines, and only calm, necessary communication. Limit emotional conversations — your ex is no longer your support system.</p>
<p>The longer you stay emotionally entangled, the longer it hurts. Re-engaging with them again and again is like reopening a healing wound. It delays the scarring. It keeps you stuck.</p>
<p>Lean on the people who show up for you. Ask for help. Text your sister. Call that one friend who gets you. You’re not meant to do this alone — human connection is one of the strongest medicines for a broken heart.</p>`,
      task: `<p><strong>Day 2 Task — Create Space</strong></p>
<p>Today’s task (along with your habit journal) is to find your home and create distance — emotionally, physically, or both.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>If you can move out:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a plan to leave today, or pick a move-out date in the next few days.</li>
      <li>Ask a loved one if you can stay with them.</li>
      <li>Start packing — even a suitcase of essentials gives you a sense of momentum.</li>
      <li>Consider hiring movers for a clean break. Fast, clean exits are often the kindest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If you can’t move out yet:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Take a trip or mini-retreat, even just for the weekend.</li>
      <li>Ask a friend or family member if you can stay with them temporarily.</li>
      <li>Set physical boundaries (sleep in separate spaces) and emotional ones (no deep convos, no checking in).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If you’ve already moved out:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Take a moment to feel proud.</li>
      <li>Text the people who helped you and say thank you.</li>
      <li>Let yourself settle in. It’s okay if it doesn’t feel like “home” yet — it will.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Distance is not rejection. It’s protection. And every step you take away from what hurt you is a step toward your healing.</p>`,

      day: 3,
      title: 'Day 3: Nurture Yourself',
      reading: `<p><em>“Nurturing yourself is the most powerful act of self-love.”</em></p>
<p>The third step in healing is to nurture yourself. This means taking care of your physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. It’s not about being selfish — it’s about giving yourself the space and resources to heal.</p>
<p>Your body needs rest, food, and water. Your mind needs space to process and clarity to think. Your heart needs time to heal and space to feel.</p>
<p>If you’re not eating, sleeping, or taking care of yourself, you’re not giving yourself the time and space to heal. You’re just prolonging the pain.</p>
<p>The most common mistake? Neglecting your own needs. When we’re in pain, we often forget to take care of ourselves. We’re so focused on the other person that we neglect our own well-being.</p>
<p>Your first step today is to acknowledge that you need to take care of yourself. You’re not a priority right now, but you are a priority. You deserve to be cared for.</p>
<p>Take a moment to think about what you need. It might be a warm bath, a good book, a walk in the park, or a nap. Whatever it is, make it a priority. You can’t heal if you’re not taking care of yourself.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to eat, try small, nourishing meals. If you’re struggling to sleep, try a sleep meditation or a guided relaxation. If you’re struggling to move, try a gentle yoga session or a walk. Whatever it takes to feel better, do it.</p>
<p>Remember: you are not your pain. You are not your breakup. You are not your ex. You are a whole person deserving of love and care.</p>`,

<p>The fourth step in healing is to release your pain. This means acknowledging and accepting the pain you’re feeling, and then letting it go. It’s not about suppressing it or fighting it — it’s about allowing it to flow through you.</p>
<p>You might feel angry, sad, anxious, or numb. This is your body’s way of processing the trauma. It’s not a sign of weakness. It’s a sign of strength.</p>

  <li>Write down the people you need to forgive. Who are they? Your ex, yourself, or both? What are they doing that hurts you? What are you doing that hurts them?</li>
  <li>Then, forgive them. Let them go. Don’t carry them with you. It’s not yours to keep. It’s yours to let go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: forgiveness is temporary. Healing is permanent. You can’t control the past, but you can control how you respond to it.</p>`,
